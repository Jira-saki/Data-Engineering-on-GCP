# The Data Set
- The dataset has been cleaned in Google colab with Spark.
- Why did you choose it?
- What do you like about it?
- What is problematic?
- What do you want to do with it?

# Used Tools
- Python, CLI , Cloudcomposer, Apache Airflow, Google cloud Storage,Big query.
- Setting environment in cloud composer and use DAG in Airflow for orchastration.
- ETL Data will be loaded to Data Warehouse ready for analysis. 


## Connect
